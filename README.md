# MyPy_TinyCodes

This is a repo of my Python codes I've written for the "Introduction to Programming Using Python" course at edx.
It has been launched by the University of Texas at Arlington, 
([UTArlingtonX: CSE1309x](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:UTArlingtonX+CSE1309x+1T2018/course/))
and includes 9 weeks of training on various Python programming topics, 4 assignments, and 6 exams. 
According to [Jadi](https://github.com/jadijadi), the course covers up to 70% of Python's mastery :D
