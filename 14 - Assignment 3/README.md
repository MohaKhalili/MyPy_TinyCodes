In the second part you are asked to write a function which searches the columns of a 2-dimensional list of characters to find a given string (word). If a match is found, then the indexes for the starting character of the match is returned. Otherwise None is returned.

In the last part you are asked to write a function which searches both rows and columns of a 2-dimensional list of characters to find a given string (word).
